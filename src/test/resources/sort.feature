@sort
Feature: Sort
  As an end user
  I want to sort the results
  So that i can see product of may choice

  @regression
  Scenario: Sort By price
    Given I am on home page
    When I search for a product "nike"
    And I set sort by filter as "Price: Low - High"
    Then I should see all the product in sorted order as "Low - High"
